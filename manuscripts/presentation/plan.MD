Project Overview: This section should provide a description of the project.
    - Use info in proposal

Project Design: This section should have two subsections as outlined below.

    Software Architecture Diagram: An architectural diagram is a visual representation that maps out the physical implementation of components of a software system. It shows the general structure of the software system and the associations, limitations, and boundaries between each software component and the relationship with external components such as databases, users, libraries, and services.
        - One for if it is possible to wrap external env in ROS2 (internal-arch)
        - One if ther must be a bridge (external-arch)
    

    User Interface Designs: The user interface is a visual representation of the front-end application view and can be displayed through wireframes, information architecture, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

Project Progress: Include an update in terms of requirements documentation, user stories, or product backlog. A summary of completed milestones and technical implementation details, issues, and strategies.
Individual Responsibilities: Each team member should present their own tasks and plan for completing those tasks.
